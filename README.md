# PhD-Model-Code

This project contains the main code used to run a Neural Mass Model simulation fit to data. The matlab simulation code is intended to be run on a multicore HPC as the model is exploring 12-14 dimensional parameter space using a genetic algorithmic approach. Once the simulation outputs have been produced, the various techniques detailed in Figures_Analysis, some of which are visualised in Figures, can be used to explore the success of each method to fit simulation to zebrafish seizure-like data.
